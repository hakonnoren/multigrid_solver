# Multigrid methods for solving the Poission equation

**Python library for the multigrid algorithm for solving linear systems of equations arising from the 2D Poisson problem (differential equation).** It contains an implementation of the conjugate gradient algorithm, but most importantly a multigrid solver. Finally you can play with the conjugate gradient using the multigrid method as a preconditioner. You will be amazed of its swift convergence and short computation time. The latter algorithm is beautifully presented in this paper:  https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2818681_The_Multigrid_Preconditioned_Conjugate_Gradient_Method

Furthermore you will find functions to test the computation time and speed of convergence of the algorithms.
